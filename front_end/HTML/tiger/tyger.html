<h1>The Tiger</h1>
<h2>by William Blake</h2>
<blockquote>
Tiger, tiger, burning bright<br>
In the forests of the night,<br>
What immortal hand or eye<br>
Could frame thy fearful symmetry?<br>
<br>
In what distant deeps or skies<br>
Burnt the fire of thine eyes?<br>
On what wings dare he aspire?<br>
What the hand dare seize the fire?<br>
<br>
And what shoulder and what art<br>
Could twist the sinews of thy heart?<br>
And, when thy heart began to beat,<br>
What dread hand and what dread feet?<br>
<br>
What the hammer? what the chain?<br>
In what furnace was thy brain?<br>
What the anvil? what dread grasp<br>
Dare its deadly terrors clasp?<br>
<br>
When the stars threw down their spears,<br>
And watered heaven with their tears,<br>
Did He smile His work to see?<br>
Did He who made the lamb make thee?<br>
<br>
Tiger, tiger, burning bright<br>
In the forests of the night,<br>
What immortal hand or eye<br>
Dare frame thy fearful symmetry?
